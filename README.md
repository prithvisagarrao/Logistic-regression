# Logistic-regression
### CSE574 Machine Learning project1

- In this project we have implemented Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent as a classification technique to predict binomial outcomes. 
- We have classified suspected FNA cells to Benign(class 0) or Malignant (class 1) using logistic regression as classifier.
